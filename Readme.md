# Gig Economy Platform Smart Contract

## Vision

The Gig Economy Platform project aims to create a decentralized marketplace for freelance and gig-based work. The platform allows job posters to list gigs with a defined reward, and workers to complete the gigs to receive payments. By using blockchain technology, this project provides a transparent and fair way to connect freelancers with job opportunities, ensuring that payments are made securely once work is completed.

## Features

- **Post Gig**: Users can post freelance jobs or gigs with a description and reward, making them available for freelancers to pick up.
- **Complete Gig**: Workers can mark a gig as completed and receive payment from the job poster.
- **Trustless Payment System**: By using blockchain technology, the platform ensures that payment is transparent and secure once the gig is completed.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Devnet
- **Contract Address**: `0x54e5c2dc19ff9ad2a55e18b35ed25338ead39a563134b0003779e2122979dd38` (Replace with the actual contract address once deployed)

## How It Works

1. **Post Gig**:

   - Users call the `post_gig` function to post a new freelance job or gig.
   - The function takes a job description and reward amount as parameters, storing the information on the blockchain.

2. **Complete Gig**:
   - Workers call the `complete_gig` function to mark a gig as completed and receive payment.
   - The contract checks if the gig is not already completed and updates its status to mark it as done.
   - The payment transfer logic is assumed to be handled in future iterations.

## Future Scope

- **On-Chain Payment Integration**: Add functionality to transfer the reward directly from the job poster to the worker using Aptos tokens once the gig is marked as complete.
- **Escrow System**: Implement an escrow feature where the reward is locked in the contract upon gig posting and released once the worker completes the gig.
- **Rating and Review System**: Allow job posters and workers to rate each other after the gig is completed, building trust and helping users make informed decisions.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Develop a dispute resolution mechanism for resolving conflicts that may arise between posters and workers.
- **Task Categories and Search**: Introduce categories for gigs and a search feature to help workers find gigs that match their skills.
- **Recurring Gigs**: Add support for recurring or ongoing gigs, allowing workers to earn steady income for long-term projects.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, users can post gigs, and workers can complete them through the smart contract functions.
